# camera_plugin_app

* For now, this repository has only camera feature without video recording etc. The codes are coming from the official camera plugin itself, and it is simplified version of it. Feel free to use it.

## Important Note
* If you want to use camera plugin, you need to test on the real devices. For the Android emulator, the front camera work as well, but back camera does not work as expected. If you try to use on your "real" device, then there will be no any issues. So, use this plugin in your code base, but test it on the real device!
